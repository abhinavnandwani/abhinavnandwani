A systems architecture-level thinker who leverages deep RTL/hardware knowledge to drive the design of domain-specific accelerators (DSAs). This involves the following 

1. Understanding the workload deeply (AI/ML, graphics, healthcare, etc.)
2. Knowing what parts of it are bottlenecks
3. Designing hardware that mitigates those bottlenecks
4. Adhere to performance, memory hierarchy, communication models, and software implications making them implementation guides for teams (RTL, VLSI, verification, compiler)
